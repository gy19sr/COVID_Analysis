# COVID_Analysis
 predicting COVID rates in UK, to determine key Policies
 
 
 
 The point of these Notebooks is to see the impact that UK policies have had on future COVID rates. I developed a Spreadsheet of key policy events from multiple sources and used that in combination with covid case rate to determine number of cases two weeks in the future. While the model could be drastically improved with further parameter tuning and inclusion of additional key features (like weather), the model uncovered three key policy categories that impact COVID rates.
 
 
The model can be found in [XG Boost Model.ipynb](https://github.com/gy19sr/COVID_Analysis/blob/main/XG%20Boost%20Model.ipynb), and subsequent analysis of the policy tracker can be found at [Policy Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/gy19sr/COVID_Analysis/blob/main/Policy%20analysis.ipynb).
